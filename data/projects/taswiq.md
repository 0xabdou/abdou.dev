This is an e-commerce application for agricultural products, where farmers can sell anything, from vegetables, livestock, to even lands. I used Flutter to build it, while collaborating with the backend team to deliver a secure and performant app, ready to be published to the stores.

(No github repo since this was a freelance project)
